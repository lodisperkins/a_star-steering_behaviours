## II. Design

1. _System Architecture_
    
	All objects inherit from the gameobject class. Each gameobject is responsible for drawing, updating and making decisions. Each gameobject has a behaviour associated with it from the objectbehaviour class. Based on the objects current behaviour, its velocity is changed accordingly. Nodes, have no velocity and therfore no behaviour. Instead, nodes positions are set based on their position in the graph. Whether the gameobjects are created as a graph or as agents depends on the user input. If A* is initialized, gameobjects become nodes and a graph is drawn to the screen showing the steps of A*. If seek behaviour is choosen, two agents are created that play an endless game of tag. If pursue behaviour is chosen, two agents are created. One is place at the bottom center of the screen and attempts to move to the top. The other is placed on the far left of the screen and attempts to catch the other by seeking where it will be instead of where it is. After it is caught the first agent then begins to evade; the two then rotate in a circle indefinitely as one evades while the other pursues.
